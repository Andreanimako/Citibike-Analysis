    "\n",
    "8,955 rides were recorded for the first quarter of 2024 in Jersey. The bike stations were mostly located in the environs of 07310 zipcode, concentrated in areas along the Hudson river. The majority of trips were taken by riders with membership. The map below can be filtered to show variations by month and by membership status(Member/ casual).\n",

    "## Temporal Analysis of CitiBike Patronage in Jersey for Q1-2024\n",
    "\n",
    "A temporal analysis of CitiBike patronage reveals a gradual increase in usage from January to March, correlating with improving temperatures. This upward trend is consistent across the top 10 start stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Use the filters to explore variations by month, usage periods and Membership status. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Member Usage Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weekdays: \n",
    "\n",
    "Member usage was highest during weekdays, with Monday and Friday seeing the most significant activity. This pattern suggests that many users prefer biking to avoid traffic on these days.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Peak Hours: \n",
    "\n",
    "The most frequent usage occurred between 4 PM and 6 PM, likely as a strategy to circumvent evening traffic. A smaller peak is also observed around 8 AM, aligning with the morning commute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Casual User Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Weekends: Casual users predominantly use the service over the weekends, with Sunday experiencing the highest patronage. This trend may be attributed to tourists, who tend to be casual users and are more active during weekends.\n",
    "These insights indicate that both members and casual users leverage CitiBike to avoid traffic, with distinct patterns based on the type of user and the time of week. The analysis underscores the importance of understanding temporal usage trends to optimize bike availability and enhance user experience.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Analysis of User Patterns for Q1-2024 in Jersey\n",
    "\n",
    "The majority of CitiBike users were registered members, accounting for 82.23% of total users. Grove Street PATH emerged as both the most popular start station and the most popular destination. \n",
    "*Station popularity can be filtered to show the pattern for electric bikes vs classic bikes\n",
    "\n",
    "Electric bikes were the preferred choice among users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the average trip duration for electric bike rides was shorter than for classic bike rides. This is intuitive, as electric bikes provide faster and easier travel with less physical effort compared to classic bikes, which require more exertion and may result in longer trip durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citibike trip distances\n",

By selecting a specific distance, users can identify which rides match the chosen trip length, as well as the corresponding start and end stations. This information can help in:\n",
